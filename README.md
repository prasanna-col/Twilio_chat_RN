# Twilio_chat_RN
Twilio chat conversation implemented in Reactnative app. To run this need to run backend server.

# Programmable chat: chat service
- This has been implemented in this project.
- We intend to sunset the Programmable Chat API on July 25, 2022 to focus on the next generation of chat: Twilio Conversations API.

- In this project, users can create a public channel and join any public channel (public channel is consider as a room). We can differentiate the channel that was created by that user or that he joined.

- Backend server: https://github.com/prasanna-col/stripe_expressJS
where, run the server.js file for twilio
